## 🧠 System Workflow

1. **Borrower** creates a loan request.  
2. **Lender** reviews and customizes loan terms.  
3. Both parties **digitally sign** the agreement.  
4. **Moderator** optionally verifies the deal.  
5. Loan becomes **active** and repayments begin.  
6. **System** tracks schedules, reminders, and closure.  
7. In later phases, **ratings and trust scores** will help strengthen relationships and transparency.
